# Bus-Station-Detection-System

RFID based Bus Stop reminder system.

This project was built with a primary focus on facilitating accessibility for the visually impaired and to ease their daily navigation.
- A person will be able to know of the bus's arrival at the stop with the help of the announcements made at the stop and in the bus.
- At the bus stop, the RFID tag reader will recognize the visually impaired person. When detected, the LED light will blink to signal to others that a person who may need way or general assistance is present. 
- When the bus arrives at the stop, the bus will be recognized by the RFID tag reader and announce the bus number. Inside the bus, with the help of the bluetooth module, simultaneously the stop name will be announced as well the LED lights will blink if there is a person who may need way or general assistance is present.
- The announcements are also displayed on LCD screens,  both at the station and in the bus, for the convenience of other travellers.
